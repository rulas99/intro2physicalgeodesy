# intro2physicalgeodesy
In this repository I worked with gravimetric data to make some basic computations of normal gravity and it's anomalies. Also, I present some algorithms to create raster data from tabular data, this rasters can be plot with map format using cartopy or the resultant tifs can be load to a GIS software
